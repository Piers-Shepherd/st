## Notes

- The basic requirements of the project have been implemented.
- The project uses Nx with [standalone setup](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/angular-standalone-tutorial).
- Unit tests pass but due to time limitations only the VehicleFeature component has any kind of useful tests.
- e2e tests mock and test basic journey.
- Almost every file can be improved. I've left some @todo comments to describe some of these.
